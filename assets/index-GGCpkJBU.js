The investor pays a premium, hoping that the asset's price will increase within the option's timeframe. For example, consider a call option on Google stock:

    **Scenario**: The option has a one-year term with a strike price set at the current market price (e.g., $100). If, at the end of the year, Google's price has risen to $120, the investor can exercise the option to purchase at $100, realizing a 20% gain by immediately selling at the market price of $120 (minus any fees).

    **Key Points**:
    [ul]
    [li]No Obligation to Buy: If the market price at expiration is below the strike price (e.g., $90), the investor can choose not to exercise the option, thus avoiding a loss from buying above market value. This illustrates why the call option relates only to potential profits and limits the loss to the paid premium.[/li]

    [li]Cash Settlement: Actual shares are not necessarily exchanged. Instead, the transaction might be settled in cash, representing the difference between the market price at expiration and the strike price if favorable to the investor.[/li][/ul]`,CO2:"With Call options, the risk is limited. The worst case scenario, you dont exercise the option and you lose the fees paid. To balance this, issuers sometimes  will limit the maximum gains. We call this a cap. Capped deals will have a **cap value**, which represents the maximum underlying value where you can make any more profit over the given maturity period. below you can see an example of a payoff graph for an uncapped vs a capped call:",CO3:`Here you can see, in the left graph, that any increase in the value of the underlying over the length of the deal is 1:1 to the profit we make. However, for the right side, while we begin with our profit at 1:1 with the underlying value, at a certain point (e.g 20% profit) we no longer realize any more gains front the underlying asset increasing in value and our profit flatlines.
    
    In this regard it is a balancing act, one might ask, "Is the protection offered by my lack of obligation worth the chance of me losing out on extra profit". The answer to this will vary depending on the investor, the asset, the timeframe etc. This is not the only way a call can change. In the first graph you may have noticed the green line didn't run in parallel to the underlying before being capped, This is to do with **Gearing/Participation**.`,CO4:"Our first example of capped vs uncapped showed how an issuer can limit profit on the upside. However, issuers also often will add incentives to their call option.Gearing/Participation (I'll exclusively user participation from hear on out for simplicity) is one of the ways they do this. The easiest way to understand participation is like a multiplier on your profit. If you have a participation of **150%** and over a year your underlying asset has increased by **10%**, you receive a profit of **15%** (10 * 1.5). Lets look at an example ofa capped trade with a participation of **100%**, vs one with **150%.**",CO5:"As you can see here, the higher the particiption rate, the more you make in relation to an increase in the underlyings value.

What this practically means is simply that, rather than investing directly in an underlying (e.g Tesla) and being exposed to the wild variations (mainly due to Elon Musk), you give your notional (the investment amount) to an issuer. They promise to invest some in Tesla, some in bonds etc, and in return they will offer some protections (you lose less money) and also counter that with some trade-offs (your profits are limited). ",WSP2:"The exact makeup of these varies wildly and the levels of these protections and limits will depend on the type of product, the underlying asset, the issuer you are trying to deal with and a host of other factors.

To fully understand structured products, it is crucial to grasp the mechanisms of these underlying options:"},ye={PO1:`A put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset at a predetermined strike price before or on the expiration date. Investors typically purchase put options to hedge against a potential decline in the underlying asset's value or to speculate on such a decline. For instance, consider a put option on Google stock:

**Scenario:** The put option has a one-year term with a strike price of 80% of Google's current market price (e.g., $80 if the current price is $100). If, at the end of the year, Google's price has fallen to $70, the investor can exercise the option to sell at $80, effectively mitigating the loss compared to the market price.

 **Key Points**:
[ul]
[li]**Protection Level**: If the market price at expiration is above the strike price, the investor can choose not to exercise the option, effectively losing only the premium paid. This feature highlights the protective nature of put options.[/li]

[li]**Cash Settlement**: Like call options, put transactions might be settled in cash, representing the difference between the strike price and the lower market price at expiration if it is beneficial to the investor.[/li][/ul]`,PO2:"So based on this we can understand that a put option gives us protection above a strike price. However, what happens if the price of an underlying falls below the strike price. This point we drop below is called the **barrier**. The exact details of how a barrier works can and will vary between each put option. However, the main categories that interest us in SP are **static** barriers and **contingent** barriers:",PO3:`
[ul][li]**Contingent Barrier:** This structure involves full principal protection unless the underlying asset falls below a certain barrier (e.g., 70%). If this barrier is breached, the protection may be entirely lost, exposing the investor to further losses as the asset devalues[/li].

[li]**Static Barrier:** Alternatively, a put might feature a static barrier (static w/gearing). This barrier does not knock you out of all protection below the strike. Instead there is a custom downside for all prices at maturity. In SP it is usually configured so that the protection is 100% until below the barrier and then for every percentage below the barrier, gearing is 1/strike. E.G if your strike is 70% your **put gearing** is 1/0.7 which is 1.43. This means that at **70%** you still get **100%** of your money back but at **69%** rather than losing **1%** you lose **1.43%** (**98.57%** return).[/li][/ul]`,PO4:`We mentioned previously that a contingent barrier is one where you can be "knocker-out". This means that if the price drops below the knock-in barrier you no longer get protection and instead simply lose your option to sell at the strike price. This observation however can be done at a few different intervals: 

[ul][li]**At maturity:** We only observe the knock-out event if it occurs at the strike date of the deal, any dips below knock in barrier prior to this are not considered.[/li]
[li]**Daily:** At the end of each day we observe the final close price. If we are below our knock-in barrier then a knock out event occurs.[/li]
[li]**Continuous:** If at any point of any day during the length of the deal, if we are below our knock-in barrier then a knock out event occurs.[/li][/ul]

In the world of SP, If a knock out event occurs, this does not end the deal. Instead you are still exposed to price movements during the length of the deal, you just also have no downside protection anymore.`,PO5:"Here are some examples of a **1 year** deal from **10/01/23** to **10/01/24**.

This coupon is usually represented as a percentage of the underlying value. For instance, a yearly coupon could have a value of **10%** coupon per annum.

    **Scenario**: The option has a two-year term with a annual coupon set at 10% CPA. At the end of the year, Google's price has risen to $120, the investor recieves $12 and the deal continues to its second year.

    **Key Points**:
    [ul]
    [li]**Coupon Frequency**: In this example the coupon pays yearly. so 10% of the current value is paid each year. The percentage is typically always listedas per year, however this frequency can vary (Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annual & Annual).[/li]

    [li]**Coupon Conditions**: In this example we didn't specify any condition for a coupon. While this is the case **sometimes**, we will more often have barriers which the price must be above to recieve the coupon, known as the 'coupon barrier'.[/li][/ul]`,CP2:"As mentioned in the key points above, any coupon is typically listed as a percentage per annum. However this often can be paid on a non yearly interval. For instance, if you had a 10% CPA and your observation frequency was quarterly then at every three months a coupon of 2.5% is paid (10%/4).",CP3:"Here you can see, in the left graph, that we recieve four coupon payments of 2.5% over time at each **observation date**. However, in the right hand graph, we recieve it all in one 10% installment at year end. You may wonder why this is referred to as an observation date, as opposed to a payment date. This is due to the other factor not yet mentioned, conditional coupons.",CP4:"When we reach each observation period (when a coupon **may** be paid), what occurs very much depends on whether our coupon is unconditional or conditional. An Unconditional coupon is paid regardless of the current price of the underlying on each observation date, so in that sense it is gaurenteed. Alternatively, a conditional coupons is only paid at each observation **if** the price of the underlying is at or above the barrier level decided at the start of the deal.",CP5:`As you can see in the left graph, every period a coupon is paid. On the other hand, in the right graph, the price was only at or above the barrier at periods 1,2 and 4 but **not period 3**. Due to this as only 3/4 coupons were paid over the length of the product.
    **N.B Conditional coupons can also have a memory feature, where if we climb back above the barrier and earn a coupon, then all previous missed coupons are paid.**`,CP6:"Below are some examples of some different coupons. a unconditional coupon, a conditional without memory and a conditional coupon with memory. **For all three the CPA is 10%.
