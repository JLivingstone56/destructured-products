    WSP1: `Structured products are pre-packaged investments that normally include assets linked to interest plus one or more derivatives. ` +
        `What this practically means is simply that, rather than investing directly in an underlying (e.g Tesla) and being exposed to the wild variations ` +
        `(mainly due to Elon Musk), you give your notional (the investment amount) to an issuer. They promise to invest some in Tesla, some in bonds etc, ` +
        `and in return they will offer some protections (you lose less money) and also counter that with some trade-offs (your profits are limited). `,

    WSP2: `The exact makeup of these varies wildly and the levels of these protections and limits will depend on the type of product, the underlying asset, the issuer ` +
        `you are trying to deal with and a host of other factors. However, once you come to understand each constituent element, you can begin to see how they all come together. ` +
        `We can break these down into a few key categories/products.`,

    WSP3: `One of these products is a Phoenix/Autocall. Its worth mentioning that these names are often issuer defined, they are not an industry standard. We will however, when ` +
        `relevant point out the meaning of the name and how it can help you understand the product (e.g 'autocall' because theres a feature that calls the note/pays you automatically) ` +

    WSP4: `Structured products often include features of both call (upside) and put (downside) options. allowing investors to gain on the upside while having some protection on the downside. `+
    `To fully understand structured products, it is crucial to grasp the mechanisms of these underlying options:`,
