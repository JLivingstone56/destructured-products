    intro1: `In this section, we will explore the world of **Structured Products**, a complex financial instrument designed to meet` + 
    `specific investment strategies and risk management needs. What exactly is a Structured Product? As you might guess from the name, these are not straightforward.`+

    `This wiki aims to demystify these sophisticated tools, making them accessible to everyone.`,

    `and 'yield enhancement' are commonly thrown around when discussing these products. Each section of this wiki breaks down these terms and the underlying concepts`+
    `in a clear and concise manner. Plus, every topic is supplemented with summaries to help reinforce your understanding and quizzes to test your knowledge.`,

    intro3: `As you progress through this wiki, you will find detailed information on how Structured Products are created, priced, and how they function in different`+
    `market conditions. By the end, you should be able to understand not only the mechanics but also the strategic use of Structured Products in investment portfolios.`+
    `Keep learning and engage with the quizzes to enhance your grasp of each topic. The journey through complex financial landscapes is challenging, `+
    `but with the right tools and explanations, it becomes much more navigable.`
