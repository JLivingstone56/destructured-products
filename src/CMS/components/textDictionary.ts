    intro1: `In this section, we will explore the world of Structured Products, a complex financial instrument designed to meet` + 
    `specific investment strategies and risk management needs. What exactly is a Structured Product? As you might guess from the name, these are not straightforward.`+
    `They are constructed from two or more financial instruments, combining derivatives with traditional securities to tailor the risk-return profile. `+
    `This wiki aims to demystify these sophisticated tools, making them accessible to everyone.`,

    intro2: `Structured Products are steeped in financial jargon which can be quite overwhelming. Terms like 'derivatives', 'principal protection', 'market-linked investment',`+
    `and 'yield enhancement' are commonly thrown around when discussing these products. Each section of this wiki breaks down these terms and the underlying concepts`+
    `in a clear and concise manner. Plus, every topic is supplemented with summaries to help reinforce your understanding and quizzes to test your knowledge.`,

    intro3: `As you progress through this wiki, you will find detailed information on how Structured Products are created, priced, and how they function in different`+
    `market conditions. By the end, you should be able to understand not only the mechanics but also the strategic use of Structured Products in investment portfolios.`+
    `Keep learning and engage with the quizzes to enhance your grasp of each topic. The journey through complex financial landscapes is challenging, `+
    `but with the right tools and explanations, it becomes much more navigable.`,

    WSP1: `Structured products are pre-packaged investments that normally include assets linked to interest plus one or more derivatives.` +
    `What this practically means is simply that, rather than investing directly in an underlying (e.g Tesla) and being exposed to the wild variations` +
    `(mainly due to Elon Musk), you give your notional (the investment amount) to an issuer. They promise to invest some in Tesla, some in bonds etc,` + 
    `and in return they will offer some protections (you lose less money) and also counter that with some trade-offs (your profits are limited).`,

    WSP2: `The exact makeup of these varies wildly and the levels of these protections and limits will depend on the type of product, the underlying asset, the issuer` +
    `you are trying to deal with and a host of other factors. However, once you come to understand each constituent element, you can begin to see how they all come together.`+
     `We can break these down into a few key categories/products.`,

    WSP3: `One of these products is a Phoenix/Autocall. Its worth mentioning that these names are often issuer defined, they are not an industru standard. We will however, when` +
    `relevant point out the meaning of the name and how it can help you understand the product (e.g 'autocall' because theres a feature that calls the note/pays you automatically)` +
    `So lets get into a brief overview of what one of these products in general will look like and then we can jump into a Autocallable specifically.`,
