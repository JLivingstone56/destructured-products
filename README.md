# destructured-products
A VanJS built site to help break down the composite parts that make up structured products and  derivatives.
This site serves two main purposes for me:
1. A test project for VanJS, Vite, GH-Pages, native js etc.
2. Explaining the basics of structured products in a simple way for the fellow devs at my work.

## Aims
- [x] Build a clear and easy to read site
- [x] Intergrate a CMS like architecture/pages to explain all the key parts of structured products
- [ ] Add a quiz section with examples
- [ ] Setup Auth/DB for storing user session data.
- [ ] Add a Q/A section for logged in users
- [ ] Mobile styling
